I joined IIT Kharagpur in 2018 as a M.Tech. student. From there onwards, my journey has been nothing short of remarkable. Hailing from a small town in India, I had always dreamt of attending one of the prestigious institutions in the country.</p>
				   <p>But it wasn't just about getting into IIT for me; Iwas determined to excel and make the most of this opportunity. My hard work and dedication paid off, and I consistently ranked among the top students in his class. I was introduced to research during masters by my supervisor Dr. Chirodeep Bakli. It wasn't long before I heard about the Prime Minister's Research Fellowship (PMRF) program, a prestigious initiative designed to nurture research talent in the country. </p>      				  <p> I knew that the PMRF program was my chance to take my academic journey to the next level. With guidance from Dr. Bakli and seniors, I began working on a research proposal that would eventually become the cornerstone of my PMRF application. My proposal, which focused on developing innovative solutions for improving efficiency of membrane based desalination systems, received accolades from the review committe</p>
				<p> The day I received the news that I had been awarded the PMRF was a day I would never forget. It was not just a scholarship; it was a validation of my hard work, determination, and potential. I was on cloud nine, and I realized that this was the opportunity I had been waiting for to make a significant impact on the world.</p>
				<p> As a PMRF scholar, my life took a new turn. I had access to state-of-the-art research facilities, international conferences, and the guidance of renowned researchers in his field. I dove headfirst into his research, working tirelessly to develop technology solutions that would revolutionize the renewable energy sector. Over the years, My work made significant contributions to the field. My findings were published in prestigious journals, and I had the opportunity to collaborate with experts from around the world.</p>
				<p>But my journey wasn't just about research. I was also passionate about mentoring and inspiring the next generation of students. I organised workshops and seminars, sharing my knowledge and experiences with aspiring scientists and engineers.
	</p> <p>
Looking back, my PMRF story is a testament to my dedication, passion, and the opportunities that can open up when one combines talent with determination. My journey from a small town to the corridors of IIT Kharagpur, and then to the global stage as a PMRF scholar, may be inspiring to some. </p>
